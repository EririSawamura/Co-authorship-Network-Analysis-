# Co-authorship-Network-Analysis-
This project aims to use network analysis techniques on a moderate-sized network dataset. Ex: &lt;year>,&lt;volume>,&lt;journal>, &lt;author1>&amp; ... &amp;&lt;authorN>, &lt;title> You can find the bibliographic dataset at: http://snap.stanford.edu/na09/hep-th.txt.
Basic function:
1) Network degree distribution.  
2) Clustering co-efficiency. 
3) Shortest path length.
4) Network centrality.
5) Network connectivity.
6) Node similarity.

Advanced function: Community discovery
1) K-clique detection algorithm
2) Modularity-based detection algorithm
3) Description of the Girvan_newman detection algorithm
